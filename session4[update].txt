1. **Find Documents**: Retrieved all documents from the "students" collection using the find() method.
2. **UpdateOne**: Updated a single document in the "students" collection where the name is "Vijay" to set the age to 15.
3. **UpdateMany**: Updated multiple documents in the "students" collection where the age is greater than or equal to 25, incrementing their age by 1.
4. **UpdateMany with Reference**: Attempted to use `this.age` to refer to the existing age value but encountered a ReferenceError. Corrected it by using `this.age` within an array context, which didn't work as expected.
5. **UpdateMany with NaN Check**: Updated documents in the "students" collection where the age is NaN to set the field "isEligible" to false.
6. **UpdateMany with Inverse NaN Check**: Attempted to update documents where age is not NaN but encountered an error because $nin needs an array. Corrected it by using $ne (not equal) instead.
7. **UpdateMany with $ne**: Updated documents in the "students" collection where the age is not NaN to set the field "isEligible" to true.

These commands demonstrate updating documents in the collection based on certain criteria, including single updates, updates using a comparison operator, and updates based on NaN values.
