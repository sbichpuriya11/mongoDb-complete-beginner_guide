1. `show dbs`: Displays a list of all databases on the MongoDB server along with their sizes in kilobytes (KiB).
   
2. `use college`: Switches the current database context to `college`.

3. `db.students.find()`: Finds all documents in the `students` collection.

4. `db.students.find().pretty()`: Finds all documents in the `students` collection and formats the output for better readability.

5. `db.students.findOne({name:"Daniel Kim"})`: Finds a single document in the `students` collection where the `name` field is equal to "Daniel Kim".

6. `db.students.find({name:'Daniel Kim'},{name:0}).pretty()`: Finds all documents in the `students` collection where the `name` field is equal to "Daniel Kim" and excludes the `name` field from the output.

7. `db.students.find({name:'Daniel Kim'},{name:1}).pretty()`: Finds all documents in the `students` collection where the `name` field is equal to "Daniel Kim" and includes only the `name` field in the output.

8. `db.students.find({name:'Daniel Kim'},{name:1,_id:0}).pretty()`: Finds all documents in the `students` collection where the `name` field is equal to "Daniel Kim" and excludes the `_id` field from the output.

9. `db.students.find({gender:"Male"})`: Finds all documents in the `students` collection where the `gender` field is equal to "Male".

10. `db.students.findOne({gender:"Male"})`: Finds a single document in the `students` collection where the `gender` field is equal to "Male".

11. `db.students.find({gender:"Male"}).pretty().limit(1)`: Finds and displays the first document in the `students` collection where the `gender` field is equal to "Male".

12. `db.students.find({gender:"Male"}).pretty().limit(2)`: Finds and displays the first two documents in the `students` collection where the `gender` field is equal to "Male".

13. `db.students.findOne({gender:"Male"})`: Finds a single document in the `students` collection where the `gender` field is equal to "Male".

14. `db.students.find({gender:"Male"}).pretty().skip(1).limit(1)`: Finds and displays the second document in the `students` collection where the `gender` field is equal to "Male", skipping the first document.

To start `mongosh`, you typically don't need to look at the log. You can simply open your terminal or command prompt and type `mongosh` followed by your MongoDB connection string. For example:

```
mongosh mongodb://localhost:27017
```

This will start the `mongosh` shell and connect to the MongoDB server running on `localhost` at port `27017`.
